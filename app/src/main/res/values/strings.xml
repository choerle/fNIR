    <string name="about_description2">Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIR) is a way to measure brain activity using infrared light to measure the concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the brain. The goal is similar to that of other brain imaging devices, such as fMRI andEEG, but fNIR is portable and cheaper. It provides affordable, safe, and portable brain imaging that other brain imaging technologies are not even capable of producing. The fNIR can easily be combined with other brain imaging technologies and includes portable and wireless systems, data processing algorithms, and end-user software. fNIRs have been proven to be great neuroimaging tools for researchers and doctors for they are able to measure brain activity during emotional, intellectual, and motor tasks. The fNIR has proved that it is very effective for studying perception and emotion-related changes of the brain in both adults and children.

    <string name="concussion_description">In the NFL, any serious blow to the head and the subsequent symptoms displayed by the player requires the medical personnel to remove the player from the field immediately and perform a neurological examination. If he is diagnosed with a concussion, he cannot return to the game. But the problem is that the players return way too soon. Even though the player will not be cleared for another week, it is common for players to take painkillers and return to the next game. Our fNIR app will allow for players to be tested everyday without the hassle of going to the hospital for an MRI to see if they can return to play that day. After reading a bunch of studies, we learned that after the initial impact, there is an increased CBF, or cerebral blood flow, which decreases over the next few days, which causes dizziness and loss of cognitive abilities. Concussions very often lead anemia which is a lack of hemoglobin in someones blood. As a result, we came up with an empirical way of testing for concussion symptoms. First, the players must go through a baseline test before the season starts, then they take the test again after their injury. The empirical data is achieved by finding the area of the enclosure between the oxy and deoxy hemoglobin plot line of the baseline graph, then comparing it to that of the post injury graph. This will accurately compare the differences in oxy hemoglobin spikes and deoxy hemoglobin dips between the two sets of data. There needs to be a lot more studies done to correlate concussion symptoms and hemoglobin levels, and really concussions in general as they are not yet fully understood. But we think this will be a great start to accurately diagnose a players neurohealth.

        "
        The fNIR is a simple device used to measure brain activity, comparable to the fMRI. Science and technology are constantly evolving. When the first computers were constructed, they were massive and complex. Only large companies and universities could afford and operate them. Now there are more computers than people. This is similar to the goal of the fNIR. In 2018, brain analysis can only be performed in hospitals and research centers and require knowledgeable professionals to operate. In the future, the fNIR could change this, allowing for anyone to measure brain performance at home, in the office, or on the road. The goal of our research is to make this dream a reality.
        Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy, or fNIR for short, is a device used to generate real-time brain analysis by sending near infrared light into the brain and measuring how much of that light is reflected back. The amount reflected depends on many factors, but the goal of fNIR is to use a wavelength of light so that oxygen is the main source of absorption. That is why two LEDs are used in this device, one at 730 nm and another at 850 nm. By collecting the intensity of the light reflected, and then applying specific algorithms to the data, it is possible to measure the amount of oxygenated hemoglobin versus deoxygenated hemoglobin. At first, the amount of oxygen is someone's brain seems almost trivial and useless. However, the amount of oxygen in a brain is directly proportional to brain activity.
        There are many applications of measuring oxygen concentration in one's brain. For example, surgeons often perform complex surgeries lasting many hours. Before the surgery, the surgeon will be at his peak and should be completely focused, however, as the surgery continues, the surgeon's focus will wear down. A tired and distracted surgeon can lead to surgical errors. However, if the surgeon wears the fNIR device and monitors oxygen levels throughout the surgery, there would eventually be a clear drop-off of oxygen concentration. When this oxygen level becomes very low, this is a sign that the initial surgeon is losing focus and a second surgeon could finish. This allows perfect management of resources for the hospital and could prevent many surgical errors. This is just one specific application, however, there are an infinite amount of applications waiting on this device.
        The reason the fNIR is so useful is because of its simplicity. While fMRIs produce a much better analysis of the brain, they are very complicated, expensive, and must be used by a medical professional. However, the goal of the fNIR is to create a brain analysis device available to the general public. A user of the fNIR simply buys a device, downloads the corresponding app, and clicks start. There is currently no device on the market allowing for such a simple way to analyze one's brain."
